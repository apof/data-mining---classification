# data-mining---classification

The main goal of this assignment is to learn using some basic data mining techniques, such as data collection, data pre-processing, data transformation, data classification and model validation.

The assignment is related to the classification of data from articles. There are 5 different types of articles (Politics, Film, Football, Business and Technology).
The dataset consists of a train_set with 12267 data points and a test_set of 3068 data points.

For the classification task, we implemented a KNN classifier and we also used SVM, Random Forest, Multinomial Naive Bayes and KNN classifiers from Scikit-learn library.

For the validation of each model we used 10-fold Cross Validation by calculating the following metrics:
1)Precision, 
2)Recall, 
3)F-Measure, 
4)Accuracy,
